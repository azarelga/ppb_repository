# Assignment 1: Stateful widgets


For this assignment, I created a **simple expense tracker** app inspired from a step-by-step tutorial by Dhaval patil on Medium (https://medium.com/@d22it209/budget-planner-app-in-flutter-959e002b458d)

## Features

</p>

There are several features and details that I created on this project:
1. There are more than 5 widgets that I use: 
   - Card - For the net worth display and transaction items.
   - ListView - For displaying the transaction list.
   - Icon/IconButton - For action buttons and empty state.
   - FloatingActionButton - To add new transactions.
   - ChoiceChip - For selecting transaction type (income/expense).
   - TextField - For entering transaction details.
   - BottomSheet - For acting as a sheet for transaction input.
   - and many others...
2. You can Create, Read, Update, and Delete transactions.
3. Net worth total shown at the top of the app, 
4. Rupiah Currency Conversion
5. Several UI adjustments (Create/Update operations through BottomSheet modal, etc.).
